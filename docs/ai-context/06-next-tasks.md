# Next Tasks

## Next Recommended

R8.3 — Runtime UI polish / next roadmap phase.

## R8.3 Goal

- Render latest-report runtime summary, issue summary, and artifact refs in the dashboard.
- Keep latest report as the dashboard source-of-truth after refresh.
- Do not expose raw runtime/auth artifacts in UI.

## Later Runtime Phases

- R8.2 — Runtime Artifact Detail Views.

## Non-Goals For R8.1 Unless Requested

- No UI work.
- No path-policy loosening.
- No production graph rewrite.
- No legacy graph migration.

## R8.2 — Runtime Report UI

Status: completed.

Implemented:
- Report page renders runtime audit data from latest report only; no runtime scan trigger and no full artifact fetch.
- Added runtime report view-model helper with summary-only/full-result handling, issue extraction, severity counts, safe screenshot ref filtering, and target/route/viewport/severity filters.
- Added runtime report panel with targets/routes scanned, viewports scanned, filtered issue list, issue detail panel, empty/error/summary-only states.
- Security display avoids raw stack, storageState, cookies, tokens, passwords, raw fill/env values, and unsafe absolute screenshot paths.

Tests run:
- `npm run typecheck --workspaces --if-present`
- `npm run build -w ui`
- `npm run build -w @lutest/contracts`
- `npm run build -w @lutest/worker-node`
- `npx tsx ./apps/ui/src/lib/runtime-report-view-model.self-check.ts`
- `npx tsx ./apps/ui/src/lib/production-graph-adapter.self-check.ts`
- `npx tsx ./apps/ui/src/lib/dashboard-data-request.self-check.ts`
- `npx tsx ./apps/ui/src/lib/dashboard-navigation.self-check.ts`

Known limitations:
- R8.2 does not implement screenshot gallery, visual overlay, auth UI, artifact detail endpoint loading, or issue auto-fix.
